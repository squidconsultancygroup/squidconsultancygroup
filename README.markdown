## Why Digital Transformation Matters

In today’s fast-paced digital economy, businesses that fail to adapt risk falling behind. Research suggests the following key statistics highlight the critical role of digital transformation:

- 63% of businesses have seen improved performance due to digital transformation efforts in recent years ([KPMG, 2023](https://mooncamp.com/blog/digital-transformation-statistics)).
- 56% of CEOs report that digital improvements have led to increased revenue ([Gartner, 2017](https://mooncamp.com/blog/digital-transformation-statistics)).
- The global digital transformation market is projected to reach $1,009.8 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 16.5% ([Research&Markets, 2020](https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics)).
- 94% of large organizations have a digital transformation strategy in place ([Backlinko, 2025](https://backlinko.com/digital-transformation-stats)).
- Digitally transformed organizations are expected to contribute over half of the global GDP by 2023, totaling $53.3 trillion ([IDC, 2020](https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics)).

These figures underscore the necessity for businesses to embrace digital strategies to remain competitive and drive growth.

<p align="center"><b>Navigate the digital deep with usâ€”where every solution leaves an ink of impact.</b></p>

In the heart of Glasgow, Squid Consultancy Group emerges as a beacon for businesses seeking to conquer the digital seas. Like the squid, weâ€™re adaptable, swift, and far-reaching, crafting solutions that connect local shops and global brands with their audiences. Our mission is to weave technology, marketing, and design into strategies that donâ€™t just floatâ€”they thrive. Rooted in Glasgowâ€™s gritty innovation, we help businesses of all sizes navigate markets with confidence, leaving a lasting mark.

The digital tide is rising, and businesses that donâ€™t swim risk sinking. Research reveals 63% of companies boost performance through digital strategies, while 56% of CEOs see revenue surges from going online ([KPMG, 2023](https://mooncamp.com/blog/digital-transformation-statistics); [Gartner, 2017](https://mooncamp.com/blog/digital-transformation-statistics)). By 2025, the digital market will hit $1,009.8 billion, and by 2023, digitally savvy businesses drove over half of global GDP, worth $53.3 trillion ([Research&Markets, 2020](https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics); [IDC, 2020](https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics)). The message is clear: a bold online presence isnâ€™t optionalâ€”itâ€™s your lifeline to growth.

We craft websites and apps that anchor your brand in the digital world. From sleek e-commerce platforms to mobile apps, our builds are user-friendly, secure, and ready to scale. We design interfaces that draw customers in and provide support to keep your digital ship steady. A Glasgow retailer, for instance, saw sales soar 30% with our online store, its seamless checkout turning clicks into cash. Whether youâ€™re launching a shop or a trading platform, we build solutions that sail smoothly through any market storm.

Our marketing strategies propel your brand to new horizons. We optimize websites to top Googleâ€™s charts, craft social media posts that spark conversations, and run ads on platforms like Google and Meta that hit the mark. A B2B client gained 40% more leads with our LinkedIn campaigns, proving our plans turn interest into action. From local Glasgow streets to global markets, we steer your brand to audiences that matter, ensuring every campaign leaves a wake of results.

Data is the compass for modern business, and we make it guide you. Our analytics platforms and AI tools reveal insights, from sales patterns to customer habits. We build dashboards that clarify and forecasts that prepare, like the startup that slashed costs 20% with our predictions. Whether youâ€™re tracking performance or automating tasks, we transform numbers into decisions, helping you chart the course ahead with precision.

Our designs are the ink that defines your brand. From logos that linger in minds to social media graphics that stop scrolls, we create visuals that stand out. A clientâ€™s new logo and posts boosted brand recall by 25%, showing how our work captures attention. Whether for websites, ads, or print, we craft looks that tell your story, ensuring your brand shines in every digital and physical port.

Project costs depend on scope, but industry benchmarks give a sense: basic e-commerce apps range from $20,000 to $50,000 over 3â€“6 months, while complex platforms like trading systems start at $100,000 for 6â€“18 months. Marketing campaigns, like SEO or social plans, cost $1,000 to $20,000 for 1â€“6 months. Analytics platforms run $10,000 to $30,000 for 2â€“4 months, with advanced systems at $80,000+ over 6â€“12 months. Branding packages start at $1,500 to $3,000 for 1â€“2 months, with campaigns at $5,000 to $15,000 for 2â€“4 months. We tailor every project to your budgetâ€”reach out for a free consultation.

Why sail with us? Our crew brings years of expertise, crafting solutions that fit your goals like a glove. From Glasgowâ€™s vibrant docks, we understand local markets and scale globally, navigating any challenge. Our track recordâ€”higher sales, stronger brandsâ€”proves we deliver.
